"""FP8-native Mistral3 VLM (dawn-ridge / Mistral-3.5 128B).

Custom wrapper around HF's ``Mistral3ForConditionalGeneration`` that:

  * Inherits the full VLM architecture (vision_tower + multi_modal_projector
    + Ministral3 language_model) so image inputs flow through Pixtral.
  * Attaches ``Mistral3FP8StateDictAdapter.for_vlm_full()`` so FP8 dequant
    runs inside the standard DCP load path (avoids HF's FineGrainedFP8
    loader, which materializes the full BF16 model on every rank pre-PP-split
    and OOMs on 80 GB H100).
  * Attaches a one-shot forward pre-hook on every rotary submodule to
    recompute ``inv_freq`` on first call — needed because HF's Ministral3 /
    Pixtral rotaries compute ``inv_freq`` in ``__init__``, so meta-init +
    ``to_empty`` leaves the buffer at uninitialized memory.

    """One-shot forward pre-hook that recomputes *this rotary module's* own
    ``inv_freq`` on first call.

    Attached per-rotary rather than on the outer VLM so it fires correctly
    under pipeline parallelism, where the outer model's ``forward`` is never
    called directly — the PP schedule dispatches each stage's sub-modules
    individually, and rotary modules run inside every attention layer.

    Background: HF's Ministral3 / Pixtral rotary classes initialise
    ``inv_freq`` (and related attributes) in their ``__init__``. Under
    ``accelerate.init_empty_weights`` that becomes a meta tensor, and the
    subsequent ``to_empty(device)`` call leaves it uninitialised device
    memory. Neither class exposes ``rope_init_fn`` as an attribute, so the
    generic ``_reinit_non_persistent_buffers`` helper doesn't match. We
    recover correctness by re-running the module's own ``__init__`` on the
    target device outside the init_empty_weights context — both Ministral3
    (YaRN) and Pixtral (2D patch positions) produce the right values this
    way, since we defer to the class's authoritative init logic.
